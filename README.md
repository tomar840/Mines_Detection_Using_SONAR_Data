# Mines_Detection_Using_SONAR_Data
Detection of Mines/Rock using SONAR Data. Accuracy has been compared among various classification models 

* This project aims to classify the obstacle under sea water as **Rock** *OR* **Mines**.

During the **Russo-Japanese War of 1904â€“1905**, two mines blew up when the Petropavlovsk struck them near Port Arthur, sending the holed vessel to the bottom and killing most of his crew in the process. This show us that why detecting mines under sea water, with good accuracy, is crucial to Navy of any country.

## 1. Data 
* I have used SONAR data available [publicly](http://networkrepository.com/sonar.php). This dataset contains 60 numerical features. 

### 1.1 Data Pre-Processing 
* This dataset does not contains any missing value and has all the features in numeric form. So, we just only need to find the relevant features. I have used [**principal component analysis(pca**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) for removing correlation among the features and reducing the dimension.

Below plot shows the variation of **explained variance** with the **number of componets** of *pca*

## 2. Model Selection 
I have compared the *accuracy* with the *number of components of PCA* for **LinearRegression**, **LogisticRegression** and **RandomForestClassifier** model. 

### 2.1 LinearRegression 
Below plot shows the variation of *accuracy of test data* with *number of components of PCA* for LinearRegression model.

### 2.2 LogisticRegression  
Below plot shows the variation of *accuracy of test data* with *number of components of PCA* for LogisticRegression model.

### 2.3 RandomForestClassifier  
Below plot shows the variation of *accuracy of test data* with *number of components of PCA* for RandomForestClassifier model.

## 3. Conclusion 
LinearRegression has the worst performance among the above models. However, there is one intresting observayion from the above *accuracy* Vs *number of pca features* graph, LogisticRegression has nearly the same performance as RandomForestClassifier (an *ensemble* model).
